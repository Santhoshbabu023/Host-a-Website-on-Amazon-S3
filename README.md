# Host-a-Website-on-Amazon-S3
This project demonstrates how to host a static website using Amazon S3. By creating an S3 bucket, uploading files like `index.html` and images, and enabling static website hosting, the site becomes publicly accessible via a generated URL. It provides a simple, scalable, and cost-effective solution for hosting static websites.
